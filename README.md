# Lynx On-Board Software

To clone, use `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/skyward-er/on-board-software.git`.

To build, use `sbs` (for more info, type `./sbs --help` on Linux or `sbs --help` on Windows).

## Folders structure

|   Folder                  |   Content                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| src/boards/               | Classes and components, divided by board.                         |
| src/entrypoints/          | Each file here is a "*main*" to be built with SBS.                |
| src/tests/                | Tests that can be built with SBS.                                 |
| src/mocksensors/          | Collection of mock sensors for testing with previous flights data.|
| src/hardware_in_the_loop/ | Framework for testing in a "hardware-in-the-loop" fashion.        |
| [skyward-boardcore/](https://github.com/skyward-er/skyward-boardcore)        | Provides the build system (SBS) and common drivers.               |
| bin/                      | Compiled binaries generated by SBS, to be flashed on boards.      |
| build/                    | MIOSIX Makefiles generated by SBS (*not important*)               |
| obj/                      | Building stuff (*not important*)                                  |


## Useful entrypoints

### Test Suite
Interactive entrypoint to test various aspects of the Death Stack hardware / software: `src/entrypoints/death-stack-x-testsuite.cpp` 

| Test              | Description                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Test power board  | Allows to test battery voltage, cutters and servo motors |
| Test stm board    | Allows to test leds and external oscillator              | 
| Test rf board     | Allows to test the IMUs, GPS and SD Card                 |
| Test analog board | Allows to test the pressure sensors and detachment pins  |

### Flight Entry
Main entrypoint to be used for flight: `src/entrypoints/death-stack-x-entry.cpp`
